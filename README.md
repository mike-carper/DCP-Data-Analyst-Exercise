# DCP Regional Planning - Data Analyst Exercise
NYC Metro Region Avg. Household Sizes and Occupied Housing Units by County in 2010 and 2020

This exercise focuses on 2020 and 2010 decennial US Census data in the counties of New York City's greater metropolitan region. Provided with pre-compiled data from the New York City Department of City Planning (DCP), the attached 'Full Exercise Notebook' processes household and population-related decennial census data and proceeds with exploratory and geospatial analysis. Shapefiles from the US Census bureau website (www.census.gov) were brought in to provide geospatial visualization. The analysis focuses on each county's average household size and changes in these over the decade, as well as changes in total occupied housing units in these counties over the decade. Findings are presented in the form of Pandas tables, GeoPandas maps and MatPlotLib bar graphs. 

This repository includes three files:
1. The full exercise notebook
2. An abridged notebook containing only the visualizations, summaries of findings and the final processed dataframe from which results were determined
3. The output .csv file, containing only 2010 and 2020 average household sizes for each county in the region, as requested by the DCP
